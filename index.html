            <h3>Knitting the Swatch</h3>
            <p>
                A swatch is simply a little square of knitting that allows you to identify what fabric is going to work best for your design. The swatch that you
                identify as the right fabric will also provide you with invaluable information that you will need to ensure the correct fit for your sweater. If you
                are on the fence about what sort of yarn you will be using to knit this sweater, you may swatch with several yarns to narrow the choice down.
                Once you have identified the yarn you want to use, you will be swatching with a few needle sizes to decide which one yields the fabric that
                will work best for your sweater’s purpose.
            </p>
            <p>
                Knit your swatches over a reasonable number of stitches: for fingering weight yarn, at least 48; for sport, at least 42, for dk, at least 36, for
                worsted, at least 30, for bulky, at least 24. This will ensure that your swatches are wide enough to measure your gauge accurately. Begin with
                a few rows of garter stitch (knit every row) to prevent curling, and then work in stockinette stitch, keeping the first and last three stitches in
                garter to prevent curling. (A little curling is fine but it’s easier to measure your gauge is the swatch lays relatively flat!) Work your swatch with
                the recommended number of cast on stitches (or a few more!) until it is at least 5” long. Knit a few more rows in garter stitch and then bind
                off using the stretchiest bind off you know. Some good ones are Elizabeth Zimmerman’s sewn bind off (described in many of her books), or
                Jeny’s Surprisingly Stretchy Bind Off, available online at <a href="http://knitty.com/ISSUEfall09/FEATjssbo.php">http://knitty.com/ISSUEfall09/FEATjssbo.php</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                I recommend swatching with at least three different needle sizes. Use the one you usually prefer for the weight of yarn you are working with,
                and then either one size smaller and one size larger, or the next two larger sizes if you are aiming for a loose, drapey fabric, or the next two
                sizes smaller if you are aiming for a firm fabric. Different needle materials *may* affect your knitting. I like acrylic needles but some knitters
                find that they don’t react well with certain fibers, so I switched needle types midway through each size section of my gauge swatch to see
                which I liked working with the best. It is essential that you use a needle size and material that is comfortable for YOU to knit with. Different
                fibers will affect the finished fabric as well. Since I’m using superwash, I anticipate needing to knit at a tighter gauge than non-superwash
                so that the fabric will hold it’s shape. I would do the same if I were knitting with silk, modal, or alpaca. If I were knitting with a cotton/
                microfiber blend, non-superwash wool or a non-superwash wool blend (where the percentage of non superwash wool is greater than 50) I
                would use a larger needle.
            </p>
            <p>
                I use eyelets or purl stitches in each section to indicate what needle size I used to knit that section. I’ve made the mistake of thinking, “oh, I’ll
                remember what needle I used” and then picked up the swatch a few weeks or months later with no certainty of the needle size--too many
                times now. So either mark them on your swatch or write them in a notebook or on your pattern so you’ll remember.
            </p>
            <p>
                Always, always, ALWYAYS!!! wash your swatch. Follow the instructions on the label that the yarn came in and wash the swatch exactly as
                you intend to wash the garment. So, if you’re working in cotton, intending to machine wash and dry your sweater, make sure to machine wash
                and dry your swatch, with a load of laundry, on the same settings you will use for the sweater. If you are using alpaca, hand wash and lay the
                swatch out to dry flat, just as you will wash and dry the garment. If you are working a lace sweater, pin out the swatch to give it an aggressive
                blocking just like you will need to do with the sweater when you wash it. If you neglect these steps, you run a serious risk of your garment
                only fitting correctly until you wash it! Fibers are known to relax or shrink due to washing and drying, so it is crucial that you wait until the
                swatch has been washed and dried before you attempt to measure the gauge.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are using a fiber that tends to stretch—like alpaca, silk, or superwash wool, it can be a good idea to hang your swatch with a little
                weight on it for a few days to simulate how the fabric of your finished piece will stretch while wearing.
            </p>
            <h4>A note on cotton and cotton blends:</h4>
            <p>
                If these yarns are machine washable, bear in mind that your fabric will shrink a bit on the first few washes. It is essential that you use a needle
                size that is comfortable for you to knit with, and to wash your swatch the same way you intend to wash your garment before you measure
                your gauge. If you knit your cotton tightly and then the stitches shrink even more on your first wash, you will end up with an armour-like
                garment and potential wrist pain from wrestling all those little stitches.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once you are done swatching, washing, and drying, you will choose the fabric that will be best for your sweater. This is simply the swatch that
                feels the best and fits the best with the purpose for your sweater that you identified in the introductory lesson. When you have chosen the
                swatch, make a note of which needle you used to knit it; this is the needle you will be using to knit your sweater. Make a note of it on these worksheets:

            <h3>Planning the Dimensions of your Sweater</h3>
            <p>
                The measurements you take for this portion of the lesson will be from your favorite sweater. It might be hand-knit, or it might be storebought,
                or, if you’ve never had a sweater you love, it could be a sweatshirt or lighter pullover. It should be a top that you love the fit of, and
                that makes you feel great. If your favorite sweater is no longer with you (since the best clothes tend to die too young) or you have truly never
                had a top you really liked, it’s ok—follow the schematic to measure your own body, estimating how you would like the gament to fit, to
                calculate your key numbers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lay your garment out flat and take the measurements indicated on the schematic. If there are any adjustments you care to make to your
                garment, such as lengthening the sleeves or shortening the torso, make them to these numbers. If you are taking measurements off of your
                own body, follow the schematic and measure over any garments you intend to wear under the sweater, such as a bra and a t-shirt.
            </p>
            <p>
                Taking time to experiment with swatching will be worth it in the long run—it is what designing is all about! Enjoy this honeymoon period
                with your chosen yarns, because next week you will be embarking on a long-term relationship with them as you cast-on your sweater!

            <h2>Lesson 2: Casting on and Working the Hem</h2>
            <p><em>Original <a href="http://tutorials.knitpicks.com/wptutorials/how-to-knit-a-sweater-lesson-2/">here</a></em></p>
            <p>
                We will begin with the body of our sweaters, which begin at the hem and are then worked up to the armpits. This
                week will cover the considerations of hems, and what stitches and treatments work for the hem that you want. The
                hem is the bottom border of the sweater. We will also begin with an easy calculation, so that you may cast on and
                work your hem in time for next week’s lesson.
            </p>
            <h3>Choosing your Hem Pattern</h3>
            <p>
                Stockinette stitch (and stockinette-based stitch patterns where the wrong side of the fabric is purled) curls naturally,
                which is a result of the knit side of the stitch actually being smaller than the purl side. So unless you want a rolled
                edge on your sweater (and some people, I’m sure, do!) you’ll need to work the first few inches of your sweater in a
                stitch pattern that is composed fairly equally of knit and purl stitches. Some very popular and easy hem treatments are
                Garter stitch, Seed stitch, Moss stich, and any type of ribbing. Turned hems are also an option--more on those later!
            </p>
            <p>
                If you don’t have a knit/purl pattern in mind already, then you may want to consult a stitch dictionary. Look for “knit/
                purl” patterns, or any stitch that appeals to you that combines knit and purl stitches. Vertical motifs are the ones most
                commonly used for hems. Swatch the patterns you are considering, if you like, so that you can get a sense of how they
                work with your chosen yarn and how they interact with the stockinette fabric you will use for the rest of the sweater.
                It may be necessary to use another needle size to make the stitch gauge of your hem match that of your sweater. If you
                are knitting a basic stitch, like two-by-two ribbing, however, further swatching is probably not necessary.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many knitting patterns direct you to cast on with a needle one or two sizes smaller than the one you intend to use
                for the bulk of the pattern. This is because tighter cuffs and waistband make a warmer sweater, with fewer gaps to let
                chill air in. If this sounds like what you want, then you should feel free to use a smaller needle. The other advantage
                of casting on with a smaller needle is that the tighter stitches are more even looking, forming a neater hem. Also,
                some stitches in which the knits and purls do not stack in neat columns, such as seed stitch and garter, are wider than
                stockinette, and using a smaller needle on these sections will make them match the width of the rest of the sweater
                better. That said, I did not bother with this and just cast on with the needle size I plan to use for the whole piece.
            </p>
            <p>
                Choose a hem treatment that you like, and you’re almost ready to go!
            </p>
            <h3>Identifying the Repeat</h3>
            <p>
                I chose a k3, p1, k1, p1 ribbing because it looks a little fancier than a plain ribbing, and because it will transform easily
                into a one-by-one ribbing which I intend to use later in the piece. Whatever border treatment you decide to use, you’ll
                need to identify the number of stitches in the repeat.
            </p>
            <p>
                My chosen pattern has a 6-stitch repeat. The repeat is the number of stitches before the pattern repeats again; so a
                k2, p2 rib has a 4 stitch repeat, and a k1, p1 seed stitch has a 2 stitch repeat. Garter stitch can be worked over any
                number of stitches and has no repeat00it will work for any stitch count. You probably shouldn’t go higher than an 8
                stitch repeat, for convenience…but if you are in love with a 12 or 20 stitch pattern then it is definitely possible (with
                some resourcefulness) to make it work! Once you have identified your repeat, you know your gauge and your desired
                measurements (which you calculated at the end of the last lesson!); you are ready to cast on!
            </p>
            <p>
                <form class="form-inline">
                    <gauge-input name="repeat"></gauge-input>
                </form>
            </p>
            <h3>First Steps</h3>
            <p>
                We’ll begin with the torso, or body of your sweater. To calculate your number of cast-on sts, refer to your gauge and 2
                to the measurement marked <measurement name="a"></measurement> on your schematic.
            </p>
            <p>
                Multiply A by 2 to get the circumference all the way around the hem of your sweater
            </p>
            <p>
                A × 2 = <expression name="a2"></expression><br>
                Now, multiply this number by S = <expression name="a2s"></expression>
            </p>
            <p>
                In my Case, S equals 4.75 stitches to the inch, and my desired measurement for the hem of my sweater is 34 inches.
                So I’ll multiply 34 by 4.75, which equals 161.5 stitches.
            </p>
            <p>
                First of all, it is not possible to cast on fractional stitches, so I’ll have to round this number up or down to a whole
                number of stitches: <expression name="a2sr"></expression>
            </p>
            <p>
                Second of all, I need to make sure that my cast on number is divisible by the REPEAT of my chosen border
                treatment. Since the stitch pattern I’m using has a repeat of 6 stitches, I need the number of stitches I cast on to
                evenly divide by 6. 162/6 = 27 so I will cast on 162 sts. Make sure to test your number carefully—if you don’t you
                will not end up with a full repeat of your stitch pattern at the end of your round.
            </p>
            <p>
                The number you calculated above, <expression name="a2sr"></expression> rounded to the nearest whole number
                that divides by your hem stitch <measurement name="repeat"></measurement> repeat, is
                your cast on number = <expression name="cast"></expression>
            </p>
            <h3>Turned Hems</h3>
            <p>
                A turned hem is a tailored hem which blends in completely with the fabric of the sweater. One the right side it is
                smooth stockinette, but unlike a plain stockinette hem, it does not curl! This is achieved by a hem facing that is
                knitted and sewn to the inside of the sweater. If you are working a turned hem, begin in stockinette; you will return to
                the CO edge at the end of the sweater to knit the inside hem facing.
            </p>
            <h3>Knitting the Hems</h3>
            <p>
                When you know what needle size you’re using for the hem, CO the number of stitches you calculated onto a circular
                needle many inches shorter in circumference than your intended measurement, and place a marker for the beginning
                of the round. I also placed a marker for the midpoint of the round, which will not be useful until later, so you are
                under no obligation to do so yet. Now, begin knitting in your chosen hem stitch!
            </p>
            <p>
                Work in your chosen stitch pattern for a few inches. You may choose this number arbitrarily, or refer to your sample
                garment for the length. I’ll be going for 4 inches, because I like the look of deep ribbing, but many find this a little
                long and work only for 2 or 3 inches. It is up to you! Refer to your favorite sweater or any sketches you have made to
                figure out the hem length that will work best for YOU.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you are done with the hem length, you will switch to stockinette. In the next lesson, we’ll go over how to work
                waist and bust shaping into the torso; but if you want a sweater with a straight body, you can skip that class and just
                work in stockinette until your piece is as long as the measurement labeled <measurement name="e"></measurement> on your schematic. Check your favorite
                sweater or sketch to see if you want waist shaping—if the body is a straight tube then you can skip it, but if there are
                any curves to accommodate bust or hips, then you will want to work some shaping.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you do want to work waist shaping, stop after your hem is complete. In the next lesson, we will be discussing
                shaping in the body of the sweater, and I promise to walk you through the math as painlessly as I can.
            </p>
            <h2>Lesson 3: Shaping the Torso</h2>
            <p><em>
                Original:
                <a href="http://tutorials.knitpicks.com/wptutorials/how-to-knit-a-sweater-lesson-3-part-1-of-2/">Part 1</a>, and
                <a href="http://tutorials.knitpicks.com/wptutorials/how-to-knit-a-sweater-lesson-3-part-2-of-2/">Part 2</a>
            </em></p>
            <p>
                Shaping refers to the decreases and increases knit into the body of a sweater that cause it to deviate from the plain
                straight lines of an unshaped sweater. In this section of our class, you will refer to your sample sweater and your
                sketch to determine the kind of shaping you will knit. If there is no change in the width of the body in your sample
                or fantasy sweater (that is, the body is just a straight tube) then you do not need to worry about shaping, just knit on
                until you have enough rows (including the hem already knit) to make the measurement <measurement name="e"></measurement> on your schematic.
            </p>
            <p>
                The instructions in this lesson address simple waist and bust shaping. If your sample or fantasy sweater is curved in
                the body like the shape of a real human torso, then you will want waist/bust shaping. Other shapes can be acheived by
                adapting these instructions--the last page of this lesson contains a discussion of these techniques.
            </p>
            <p>
                In order to calculate the waist shaping that will work for YOUR sweater, you will need these key measurements from
                your schematic (provided in lesson 1.)
            </p>
            <p>
                First, multiply <measurement name="a"></measurement>, <measurement name="b"></measurement>, and <measurement name="c"></measurement>
                by 2 to get the circumferences around these parts of the torso:
            </p>
            <p>
                2A = <expression name="a2"></expression><br>
                2B = <expression name="b2"></expression><br>
                2C = <expression name="c2"></expression>
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, subtract 2B from 2A, and from 2C:
            </p>
            <p>
                2A – 2B = <expression name="a2_b2"></expression> inches to DECREASE from hem to waist.
                2C – 2B = <expression name="c2_b2"></expression> inches to INCREASE from waist to armpit.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, convert these INCHES measurements to STITCHES by multiplying the last 2 numbers above by S, your
                stitch gauge (as calculated in lesson 1), and then round to resulting numbers (which may have decimals as well!) so
                they are divisible by 4.
            </p>
            <p>
                <expression name="stitches_decrease_hem_to_waist"></expression> stitches to DECREASE from hem to waist.<br>
                <expression name="stitches_increase_hem_to_waist"></expression> stitches to INCREASE from hem to waist.
            </p>
            <p>
                We will be shaping the sweater with decrease and increase rounds that eliminate or add 4 stitches per round. That is
                why you rounded the above numbers so they are divisible by four! Now, divide the above numbers by 4, to find the
                NUMBER OF DECREASE/INCREASE rounds needed for your shaping:
            </p>
            <p>
                <expression name="decrease_rounds_hem_to_waist"></expression> DECREASE rounds between hem and waist (1)<br>
                <expression name="increase_rounds_hem_to_waist"></expression> INCREASE rounds between waist and armpit (2)
            </p>
            <p>
                We’ll leave these numbers for a moment and now take a look at our vertical measurements from the schematic. We’ll
                begin with the decrease section, for which you will only need the numbers labeled (1) above. The increase section will
                be worked later in a similar way, and will use the numbers labeled (2).
            </p>
            <p>
                You have already worked a certain number of inches of length into you hem, so subtract this number from
                <measurement name="d"></measurement> (from
                your schematic) to find the distance you still need to knit to reach the waist:
            </p>
            <p>
                <measurement name="d"></measurement>
                – <input ng-model="lesson3_hem.value" class="form-control" style="width:5em; display: inline" type="number">
                = <expression name="d_hem"></expression> inches
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, multiply this number by R to see how many rows you have until you reach the waist:
            </p>
            <p>
                Inches × <measurement name="r"></measurement> = <expression name="rows_to_waist"></expression>
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, round this number to one that is divisible by (1), which you calculated above.<br>
                Rounds until waist = <expression name="rounds_to_waist"></expression>
            </p>
            <p>
                We will be working the shaping as follows: you will work a decrease round (I’ll explain that in a moment!) and then
                work a certain number of plain rounds, and then repeat, until you have reached the waist and decreased away all the
                stitches you needed to (as calculated above.) The decrease round plus the number of round before the next decrease
                can be calculated by dividing this last number by (1) = <expression name="lesson3_3"></expression> (3)
            </p>
            <p>
                Remember that the decrease round counts as one round, so subtract 1 from (3) to find the number of plain rounds
                between the decrease rounds:<br>
                (3) – 1 = <expression name="plain_rounds_between_decrease"></expression> plain rounds between decrease rounds
            </p>
            <p>
                Well, that is enough maths for me! Let’s work through this section before moving on to the increase section. If you
                like to get every bit of math out of the way, you can skip ahead and return to this later. But I am anxious to get back to
                knitting, so I’ll knit this first and calculate my increase section later!
            </p>
            <p>
                A ROW COUNTER can be indispensible at this point in your project, because you will need to keep track of which
                round you are on, to keep the decrease rounds evenly spaced. An experienced knitted may be able to read her work
                well enough that a row counter is not necessary, but I find that a row counter makes life much easier! You may also
                note your number of rounds with a tally system on paper, which works just as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                First, you will work a decrease round as follows. You have a marker at the beginning of your round (this is where I put
                my row counter) and one at the center of the round. The first half of the stitches on your circular needle is the front
                of the sweater. The second half of the stitches is the back of your sweater. The markers mark the side seams. We are
                going to place our decreases on either side of the side seams. In pattern talk, this means your decrease round is worked
                like this, starting at the beginning of the round:
            </p>
            <p>
                K1, ssk, k to 3 sts before marker, k2tog, k1. Slip marker and repeat.
            </p>
            <p>
                4 stitches have been decreased!
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, work as many plain rounds as you calculated in the final step above.
            </p>
            <p>
                You will repeat these steps: Decrease round, plain rounds <expression name="plain_rounds_between_decrease"></expression> times.
                <expression name="plain_rounds_between_decrease"></expression> refers to the number of decrease rounds that
                you calculated above. Because we used the math above to space the decrease rounds evenly over the number of rounds
                needed to reach the waist, we now have knit the torso of the sweater as far as the waist, and have shaped it so that it
                will fit correctly over the waist and hips!
            </p>
            <p>
                We will now use the same process to calculate the increase rounds that will shape the body of the sweater between the
                waist and the armpits.
            </p>
            <p>
                Return to your vertical measurements. Subtract <measurement name="d"></measurement>
                from <measurement name="e"></measurement> to find the length of the garment between waist and armpit
            </p>
            <p>
                E – D = <expression name="e_d"></expression> inches from waist to armpit.<br>
                And now multiply this number by R to find the number of rounds from waist to armpit:
            </p>
            <p>
                Inches × R = <expression name="rounds_waist_to_armpit_raw"></expression>
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, round this number to one that is divisible by (2), which you calculated above.<br>
                Rounds from waist to armpit = <expression name="rounds_waist_to_armpit"></expression>
            </p>
            <p>
                The increase section will be worked exactly like the decrease section: an increase round that adds 4 stitches will be
                followed by a certain number of plain rounds, and then the whole process will be repeated (2) times. (2) is the number
                of increase rounds you calculated above.
            </p>
            <p>
                The increase round plus the number of round before the next decrease can be calculated by dividing this last number
                (rounds from waist to armpit) by (2) = <expression name="lesson3_4"></expression> (4)
            </p>
            <p>
                Remember that the increase round counts as one round, so subtract 1 from (4) to find the number of plain rounds
                between the increase rounds:<br>
                (4) – 1 = <expression name="plain_rounds_between_increase"></expression> plain rounds between increase rounds.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now we are ready to finish the torso of the sweater!
            </p>
            <p>
                Once you have completed the decrease section above (and this includes knitting the required number of plain rows at
                the end of the lat repeat!), you will work the increase section, as follows. Work one increase round as follows, starting
                from the beginning of the round:
            </p>
            <p>
                (Note: I use a backward loop over the right hand needle as my M1 increase because I find it to be the most invisible.
                One of the most popular increases these days if KFB, which I do not recommend, because it will throw off your stitch
                counts and is very visible on the right side of the work.
            </p>
            <p>
                K2, m1, k to 2 sts before marker, m1, k2. Slip marker and repeat. 4 sts increased.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now work the number of plain rounds between increase rounds that you calculated above.
            </p>
            <p>
                You will repeat these steps: Increase round, plain rounds <expression name="increase_rounds_hem_to_waist"></expression> times.
                <expression name="increase_rounds_hem_to_waist"></expression> refers to the number of increase rounds that
                you calculated above. Because we used the math above to space the increase rounds evenly over the number of rounds
                from waist to armpits, we now have knit the torso of the sweater as far as the armpits, and have shaped it so that it
                will fit correctly over the waist and chest!
            </p>
            <h3>Further Modifications</h3>
            <p>
                As you become more proficient at shaping your sweaters, you can modify the above instructions to achieve a variety of
                effects. The adventurous knitter may wish to try some of them right now!
            </p>
            <p>
                Instead of placing the lines of decreases and increases at the side seams, you may move then closer to the center of
                the sweater to make mock princes seams that are visible on the front and the back of the body. You can change the
                directions of the increases and decreases when you do this (switch ssk for k2tog and vice-versa) for a different effect as
                well.
            </p>
            <p>
                You may modify your D and E numbers to allow for longer stretches of plain knitting, either to accommodate a long
                waist, or to finish your increases well below the armpits (which can work better for larger busts) and work plain for
                the remainder of the sweater’s length.
            </p>
            <p>
                You may also shape the bust with short rows—this works well to accommodate larger busts and adds extra length to
                the front of the sweater, so that the hem stays even. If you would like to try some short rows, you will need to identify
                the largest part of your bust, and work them, when you reach that height in the torso. Typically this is about halfway
                through in increase section. When you reach this point, put your increases on hold while you work the short rows;
                you will resume working the increases when they are done.
            </p>
            <p>
                The short rows will be worked across the front of the sweater (the first half of your stitches) only. The number of
                short rows worked is up to you—work more if you are using a thinner yarn, fewer if you are using a heavier yarn.
                To work the short rows, knit to one stitch before the first marker, then wrap and turn. Purl back to one stitch before
                the beginning of the round marker, then wrap and turn. Knit to a few stitches (3-6, more for a light yarn and less for
                a heavy one) before the first wrapped stitch, wrap and turn again, then purl back until you are the same number of
                stitches before the wrapped sts, and wrap and turn again. Repeat this process, always wrapping the stitch the same
                number of sts before the last one, until you have 3-6 wrapped stitches on each side of the torso (more for a large bust,
                fewer for a smaller one), ending after a purl row. You do not want the wrapped stitches to reach all the way across the
                torso, rather, you want the bunched up at either side, like bust darts on a tailored jacket.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, knit across until you come to a wrapped stitch. Work this stitch together with its wrap, and continue knitting
                until you reach the next wrapped stitch. Wrap and turn again. Now purl until you reach a wrapped stitch at the other
                end of the row. Work this stitch together with its wrap, and continue in purl until you reach the next wrapped stitch.
                Wrap and turn again. Repeat this process until you have knit the final wrapped stitch on a knit row. One wrapped
                stitch near the beginning of the round should remain unworked. Resume knitting in the round, and work this last
                wrapped stitch together with its wraps when you come to it. Resume your increases when you return to working in
                the round as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you feel like trying any of these modifications on your current sweater project, go right ahead! Or, feel free to file
                them away for future reference—when you have more experience with custom sweater knitting, you will find it much
                easier to implement them.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you have finished all the steps in this lesson (which may take more than one week, as it will for me!) you are
                finished with the torso of your sweater! We’ll be letting it rest while we work the sleeves, which are coming at you for
                next week’s lesson. Give your self a big pat on the back when you have finished this step—you are well on your way to
                having a finished sweater!
